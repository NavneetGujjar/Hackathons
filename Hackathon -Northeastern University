>>. I have created the hackathon depicting the crime rate in Allston, Texas. 
>>. We have used various types of graphs to present the data. The plots that we used were bar chart, line charts, maps.
>>. We have created all these graphs in Flourish.studio and R.
>>. R was mostly used for data cleaning as we have presented only specific data.

Below is the link of the google site of the Hackathon that we have created.
